# pd-abstractions-and-libraries

These are some abstractions (and libraries of abstractions) for Pure Data 0.43.4-extended or Pd-l2Ork (I recommend building the latter from source).

Any quesions, comments, bugs, criticism, feel free to contact me.

Please note that disis_munger~ is based on the PeRColate's munger~ object, written by Dan Trueman (http://www.music.princeton.edu/~dan/) and R. Luke DuBois (http://www.lukedubois.com/), and then Flext ported and improved by Ivica Ico Bukvic (http://ico.bukvic.net and http://disis.music.vt.edu) and Ji-Sun Kim (hideaway@vt.edu and http://www.cctad.vt.edu). I am simply sharing a 64-bit Linux build for pd vanilla/extened of this external which at this time is not available, and so I had no participation in the creation of this external.
